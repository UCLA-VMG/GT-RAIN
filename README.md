## Abstract
We propose a large-scale dataset of real-world rainy and clean image pairs and a method to remove degradations, induced by rain streaks and rain accumulation, from the image. As there exists no real-world dataset for deraining, current state-of-the-art methods rely on synthetic data and thus are limited by the sim2real domain gap; more- over, rigorous evaluation remains a challenge due to the absence of a real paired dataset. We fill this gap by collecting the first real paired deraining dataset through meticulous control of non-rain variations. Our dataset enables paired training and quantitative evaluation for diverse real-world rain phenomena (e.g. rain streaks and rain accumulation). To learn a representation invariant to rain phenomena, we propose a deep neural network that reconstructs the underlying scene by minimizing a rain- invariant loss between rainy and clean images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art deraining methods on real rainy images under various conditions.
